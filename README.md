## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Even though the project was very simple and small, it definitely taught me some things. Here are some things I learnt from this project:
1. Be aware while applying margin properties
2. Applying `width : 100vw;` to body causes scrollbar.
3. Even small projects may take more time than we tend to estimate.

### Continued development

I am going to continue learning CSS in more depth, especially new properties like `block-width` etc. and going to focus more on responsive width properties. Flexbox, functions like `filter()` will be on my radar now.


### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://www.chatgpt.com) - It's the ultimate debugger especially when there are time constraints.

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Very helpful when I get confused or not sure about certain properties and rules.

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - I took help from here when my body got a scrollbar.
